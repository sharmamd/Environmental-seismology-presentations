I conducted an extensive literature review, concentrating on a range of environmental seismology topics, such as fluvial seismology, volcano seismology, and glacial seismology. I presented case studies for each of these subjects.
In the realm of fluvial seismology, my focus was on analyzing seismic noise along the Trisuli River in Nepal. Shifting to volcano seismology, I delved into a case study centered on the Kilauea Volcano in 2018. Finally, I scrutinized a 
case study involving the Chamoli disaster in India in 2021, where a massive ice and rock avalanche occurred in the Himalayas.

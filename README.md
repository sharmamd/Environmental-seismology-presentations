In these three month of internship I done literature review on various environmental Throughout my three-month internship, I undertook an extensive literature review, concentrating on a range of environmental seismology topics,

In the realm of fluvial seismology, my focus was on analyzing seismic noise along the Trisuli River in Nepal. Shifting to volcano seismology, I delved into a case study centered on the Kilauea Volcano in 2018. Finally, I scrutinized a
